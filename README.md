# Zhuhai_Transit_Accessibility

## Objective
The main objective of this study is to caculate and visulaize transit accessbility measures using Hansen type (citation needed) definitions for the city of Zhuhai.

## Why transit accessibility matters.


## Opportunities
Zhuhai is a small city in the southern part of Guangdong province. In Jan 2018, it has a population of roughly 1.65
 million. The transit system in Zhuhai is fairly simple. The 150 or so transit lines are all regular buses, except for 1 light rail line. The bus routes are all operated by one state-owned enterprise. The bus company publishes good quality departure and arrival logs which makes this study possible.

## Study plan
1. build GTFS from GPS traces and departure and arrival logs
2. use the OTP(?link) engine to calculate transit skims
3. calculate transit accessibility measures
